# Cold-War-Enhanced
A mod intended to make the vanillia cold war scenario in the game Supreme Ruler Untimate more multiplayer firendly with extra goodies.

Description:
This mod is designed to fix many problems that my MP group encountered in the Cold War sandbox. It also includes some of
our most favorite ease of life wants. This mod was solely designed for multiplayer but is compatible in singleplayer
aswell. Many changes were based on historical and MP balancing decisions. Some things that we found to be incorrect were
things like how the soviets did not have long range rockets at start. The 10ks was a massed produced reversed engineered
V-1 rocket that was canned in the early 1950's. However it was still produced in the hundreds.

There is {lost count ~1000} custom events, and hundreds of fixed vanilla events.

This mod uses as few files as possible to keep the install simple and save on file sizes.
